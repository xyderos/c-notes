# Declarations

## Priority between declarations

1) There is the __[]__ **array subscription** operator which __denotes an array__

2) There is the __()__ **function call** operator which __denotes a function__

3) There is the __*__ **dereference** operator which __denotes a pointer__

4) There are the __()__ **parentheses** which override the associativity of the other operators

## How to read declarations

* Start from the the __identifier__ and apply the operators mentioned above based on their priority mentioned above

1) for **array subscriptions**, from the left to the right eg __something[X]__ is __an array of size x of__

2) for **function calls**, from the left to the right, eg __something(a1,a2)__ is __a function taking a1, a2__

3) for **dereferences**, from the right to the left eg __*something__ is __a point to something__

* You always __end__ on the __left side of the declaration__

## Multiple declarations

* Split multiple declarations by comma within a single statement

## How to use

* Since declarations show __usage__, this also means that you can also see the __order of operations that can be applied to the declaration to extract the first operator by simply applying all the operations__
